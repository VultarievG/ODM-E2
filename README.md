# ODM-E2
My latest ODM Expression 2 script for flying around like in Attack on Titan with realistic physics.

# Instalation
Download this repo and unpack the contents of ODM-E2 (excluding this README) to:
  steamapps/common/GarrysMod/garrysmod/data/expression2/
Make sure to keep libltrails.txt inside the include folder during your instalation.

You should be good to go! (Check Controls section)

# Running
In the expression2 editor you can search for the main e2 (vul's_odm.txt), double click the file when you find it.
Then leave the e2 editor and place the E2 anywhere!

# Controls
There are a few keys to know using this E2.
You can feel free to change these keybinds if you choose.

There are two keys for controlling the two main grapple hooks called
  RightKey and
  LeftKey
 by default these keys are set to "mouse_4" and "mouse_5"
  mouse_4 and mouse_5 are buttons on the side of my mouse,
To fire a hook press and release a hook key quickly, when the hook hits something, you can reel it in by pressing and holding the same hook key
To retract a hook that has hit something, press and release the hook key quickly, too slow and you will just reel in.

Then there are the flare controls, theses are just for roleplay and are only visual.

To fire a flare you press the
  SmokeKey, which is by default "e"

To switch what color (Green, Yellow, or Red) flare you wish to fire you can press the
  SmokeNext and
  SmokePrev
 keys which are by default "up" and "down" respectively (up and down arrow keys)
